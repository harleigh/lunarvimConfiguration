# lunarvimConfiguration
bits regarding LunarVim and my cobbled together customizations; all of this jazz is playing in windows 10.


Windows:
* Resizing Windows: In normal mode hold ctrl and hit arrow keys left/right

Tabs:
* Shift h and l (<S-h>, <S-l>) lets us toggle between buffer (tabs)

Terminals:
* Alt 1, 2, 3 for various types of terminals (horizontal, vertical, float)
* We can loose focus in the terminal (e.g. after pasting with mouse), we gain terminal back by going into
insert mode (i)
* A *beutiful* toggled terminal with <C-\> 

Markdown:
* glow is a simple no nonsense markdown viewer done in-terminal, without any messing about with plugin. All
that is required is a call on the terminal 'glow'. So, all of the markdown can be done entirely in LunarVim.

React JSX:
* nvim-ts-autotag is a must; beautiful autocompletion of tags just like in vscode.
