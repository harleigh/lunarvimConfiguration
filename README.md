# lunarvimConfiguration
bits regarding LunarVim and my cobbled together customizations; all of this jazz is playing in windows 10.


Windows:
* Resizing Windows: In normal mode hold ctrl and hit arrow keys left/right
* 

Terminals:
* Alt 1, 2, 3 for various types of terminals (horizontal, vertical, float)
* After pasting with mouse, gain terminal back by going into insert mode (i)
* A beutiful toggled terminal with <C-\>
